    "* Python is a high-level (human-readable) programming language that is processed by the Python “interpreter” to produce results.\n",
    "* Python includes a comprehensive standard library of tested code modules that can be easily incorporated into your own programs.\n",
    "* The Python language was developed by _Guido van Rossum_ in the late eighties and early nineties at the **National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands**.\n",
    "* Python is derived from many other languages, including C, C++, the Unix shell and other programming languages.\n",
    "* Today, Python is maintained by a core development team at the Institute, although Guido van Rossum still holds a vital role in directing its progress.\n",
    "* Python is named after the British television comedy series “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” – you may encounter references to this in the Python documentation.\n",
    "* Currently, the final 2.7 version is out, with a statement of extended support for this end-of-life release. The 2.x branch will see no new major releases after that.\n",
    "* The 3.x branch is under active development and has already seen several stable releases."

    "* **Python is easy to learn** – has a simple language syntax.\n",
    "* **Python is easy to read** – is uncluttered by punctuation.\n",
    "* **Python is easy to maintain** – is modular for simplicity.\n",
    "* **Python is “batteries included”** – provides a large standard library for easy integration into your own programs.\n",
    "* **Python is interactive** – has a terminal for debugging and testing snippets of code.\n",
    "* **Python is portable** – runs on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.\n",
    "* **Python is interpreted** – there is no compilation required.\n",
    "* **Python is high-level** – has automatic memory management.\n",
    "* **Python is extensible** – allows the addition of low-level modules to the interpreter for customization.\n",
    "* **Python is versatile** – supports both procedure-orientated programming and object-orientated programming (OOP).\n",
    "* **Python is flexible** – can create console programs, windowed GUI (Graphical User Interface) applications, and CGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripts to process web data."
